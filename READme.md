## Project Overview

This project is a prototype of a **mobile banking application** that is designed with inclusivity and accessibility in mind, particularly for users with **motor disabilities**. The prototype follows accessibility guidelines like **WCAG 2.1** and integrates **universal design principles** to ensure ease of navigation, large touch targets, and compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice input.

The app’s core functionalities include:
- **Account overview** (view balances, recent transactions)
- **Transfer money** (between accounts and to other users)
- **Pay bills** (schedule and manage bill payments)
- **Profile settings** (manage user account and adjust accessibility settings)

The file `Home-Banking_Prototype.vp` contains the visual wireframes and interactions of the prototype.

## Features

### 1. **Inclusive Design for Motor Disabilities**
   - **Large touch targets**: All interactive elements (buttons, forms, links) have a minimum size of 48x48 dp with ample spacing between them to prevent accidental taps.
   - **Simplified navigation**: The navigation is clear and minimal, allowing users to complete key tasks (e.g., transferring money, paying bills) in a few steps.
   - **Keyboard and voice navigation support**: The app is compatible with keyboard inputs and voice commands, reducing the reliance on fine motor skills.
   - **Haptic feedback**: Provides tactile confirmation for key actions such as making a payment or completing a transfer.

### 2. **Accessibility Settings**
   - **Adjustable text size**: Users can increase the size of text for better readability.
   - **Contrast options**: Users can toggle between different color contrast modes for visual clarity.
   - **Voice command support**: Users can perform actions through voice input (e.g., "Transfer money to John").

### 3. **Core Features**
   - **Account Overview**: Displays a clear view of the current balance and recent transactions. Users can navigate to see transaction details with a single tap.
   - **Transfer Money**: Allows users to transfer funds between accounts or to other users. The process is streamlined with large fields and clear buttons.
   - **Pay Bills**: Users can schedule and pay bills with ease. The app features a list of pre-saved billers, making it easy to manage recurring payments.

## Design for Accessibility

This project emphasizes compliance with **WCAG 2.1 guidelines** and **universal design principles** to ensure that users of all abilities can interact with the app smoothly. The following considerations have been made:
- **High contrast text**: Ensures readability, especially for visually impaired users.
- **Avoidance of color-only cues**: Information is not conveyed by color alone, ensuring that color-blind users are not disadvantaged.
- **Error feedback**: Clear, readable error messages with suggestions for corrections, preventing confusion during tasks like form submissions.
- **Voice input compatibility**: The app supports voice commands for users with motor disabilities who might have trouble tapping smaller touch targets.

## Prototype

The file `Home-Banking_Prototype.vp` is the primary design and interaction prototype of the banking app. It showcases:
- Wireframes for key screens such as login, account overview, transfer money, and settings.
- Interactive flow of the user journey through tasks like transferring funds or paying bills.
